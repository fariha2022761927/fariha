            <h2>More About My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                Listening to musics really does heal my stress and it is giving a good vibes for me as a student.
                In fact, I do listen to musics every single day and I could not even to not to listen to musics
                in a day because musics is my life and the way I forget my problems or having a bad day.
                <b>Ariana Grande</b>.
                <br>
                <br>
                The big reason why I love all of her songs is because the lyrics match with my soul very well. Each of her 
                top famous songs are very nice to hear and related to my life so much.
                Below are my top favourite song from this singer. Please enjoy !!
                <br>
                <br>
                <h3>My Favourite Songs</h3>
                <iframe width="250" height="170" src="images/position.jpg" frameborder="5" alt="Positions"></iframe>
                <iframe width="250" height="170" src="images/moonlight.jpg" frameborder="5" alt="Thinking bout you"></iframe>
                <h3>Watch movies</h3>
                <iframe width="250" height="170" src="images/purple hearts.jpg" frameborder="5" alt="Purple Hearts"></iframe>
                <br>
                <br>
                Other than that, I also loves to watch movies as my hobby.<u>Purple Hearts</u>. This movie is one of the famous movies on netflix whereby the movie is about 
                Cassie, a poor singer-songwriter, chooses to marry a troubled Marine
                named Luke for military perks. The distinction between real and fiction 
                starts to blur. Long story short, this movie is very romantic and I like
                how the storyline goes from enemy to lovers and I find it so cute and 
                it is not cliche romantic movies at all.

        <h4> style="text-align: justify">
            My wishlist are going to visit nature and city vibes as soon as I got employed.

            The reason why I chose that kind of place because I love somewhere that makes me feel at ease and peaceful life.

        <a href="images/city.jpg"> <img src="images/city.jpg" style="float: left;" height="170" hspace="15"></a>
        Another place that I would like to go is any country that has city vibes such as Paris, London, Korea and Japan.

        This kind of places really does change my mood from no energy to extra energy because whenever I see the streets, 

        the lights at night and the most healing thing is the environment of the city itself when you go on travels.

        Moreover, travel around the world really makes your eyes wide open to see their different culture and appreciate

        their beautiful country compare to us in Malaysia. Besides, travel is like to reward yourself from stress or a 

        long hectic month so you really need to go out and clear your mind by travelling around the world. Everyone deserve 

        to have a break for a while before continue their daily life. So, I personally think by travelling

        around the world really helps you to clear your mind and take a moment to enjoy the God's creation.
